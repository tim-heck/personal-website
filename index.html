            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I graduated from Bethel University in Saint Paul, Minnesota with a Computer Science Degree and Graphic
                Design and Math Minors. I have a passion for design and photography that I hope to integrate into the
                Computer Science world. My hometown is Burnsville, MN, but I currently reside in Saint Paul, MN.</p>
            <p>I love Jesus, my family, autumn, kicking it with my best friends, longboarding, gaming, rocking on the
                guitar in my pop-punk band GreasySauceBoss, and craft beers... you know typical hipster stuff. I am a
                big gamer. Xbox is where I feel at home, but I’m branching out to the Playstation side. I play guitar
                and ukulele, and also sing a little. If I could choose to do any job for the rest of my life, I would
                play guitar and sing in a my band and love every second.</p>
